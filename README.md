## 📖 Description

Welcome to **Labirinto de Luz** (Labyrinth of Light), a game created as part of a coding challenge. In this unique adventure, you find yourself in a mysterious and immersive dark maze filled with intrigue. Your objective is to navigate through the labyrinth and collect all the radiant light sources scattered throughout its intricate pathways.

**The Challenge:** This project was born out of a coding challenge proposed by my friend **Opuiguim 10**. The challenge was to create a complete game within the tight timeframe of just two hours. The goal was not only to build an engaging game but also to demonstrate the capabilities of rapid development and problem-solving.

**The Gameplay:** As you venture deeper into the maze, your primary objective is to gather every shining light source you come across. These sources not only illuminate your path but also provide precious additional time. However, beware! The maze is fraught with cunning obstacles and menacing enemies that will do everything in their power to extinguish your light sources and thwart your progress.

**A Race Against Time:** The clock is ticking, and you must make quick decisions to outwit the challenges that lie in your path. Your ultimate aim is to conquer the labyrinth, collecting all the light sources, and reach the exit before time runs out.

Are you up for the challenge? Dive into **Labirinto de Luz** and test your skills in this thrilling game of strategy, speed, and cunning. Enjoy the adventure and embrace the opportunity to witness the creative process behind a game developed in just two hours. Thank you for joining us on this journey into the *Labyrinth of Light*!
